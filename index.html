          Welcome. This website captures an ongoing spill of my guts.
        </p>
      <p>
        It's a fresh space for my unfiltered musings - a vault of memories, reflections, rambles, and knowledge, unfolding chapter by chapter. 
      </p>
      <p>Lose yourself in it. Wander freely.</p>

        <p>My name is Sarah and I started the blog "Sincerely, Sarah" as an outlet for me to explore my thoughts, share my passions, and document my life in an aunthentic way. 
            Starting a blog has been a long-time dream of mine; having a little corner of the internet to myself always seemed so cool to me.
