          <p>It is 12:04 P.M. on Tuesday, December 9th, 2025. I'm writing this post with an electric feeling of happiness in my heart. I just watched a 3Blue1Brown video about eigenvectors and all of a sudden I felt it.. I felt everything click. </p>
          <br>
          <p>I realize that throughout this semester, I've continuously watched myself push the boundaries for what I thought was possible. I was fully prepared to drop this course and drop the entire math major if this class didn't go well. Here I am, three months later. The final is in three days and I'm feeling incredibly proud of how far I've come.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I am so grateful and so lucky to be given countless opportunities at this point in my life to watch my expansion. There is no better feeling than watching yourself grow into the person you once dreamed of becoming. Being a math major was only a weak wish one year ago, I wasn't sure if I'd be able to pull through. Here I am now and I've finally proved to myself that it's possible, all thanks to me.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The beginning days of this class were rough. The learning curve was STEEP. I felt like I did not belong, but for some reason, I didn't give up hope or get too down on myself. I had a quiet, yet firm knowing in the back of my mind that I would pass this class and I would learn so much. I just had to stick it through. And I might not have gotten the best scores on the tests (both of my midterms were below the average), but in my heart, I always felt proud. I knew I had come a long way, and to compare myself with others in the class would be a big mistake. </p>
          <br>
          <p>Proving other people wrong is fun and all, but proving YOURSELF wrong? Surpassing your OWN expectations? I could hardly imageine a life worth living without. I am so grateful for the chances I have every single day to prove myself wrong, and be better than what I anticipated.</p>
          <br>
          <p>If I were to take this class again, I would come in HOT in terms of learning and attitudes towards my own success. I would start the semester extremely strong with learning MORE than necessary so I can build a strong foundation and intuition fast. I would also feed myself positive thoughts and come into the class with the natural mindset that I will do great.</p>
          <br>
          <p>What I did this semester was that I came in very slow. The intuition didn't hit until the day before the first exam. And my attitude for the class was just "let's see how this goes, I'm not expecting too much." I appreciate myself for not being too destructive and focusing more on empathy, but in the future, I would like to come in with the attitude "I was born to do great in this class. It's inevitable that I will succeed to great heights."</p>
          <br>
          <p>That new attitude would remove so much of the friction and fear of trying. GOod thing is, I have four math classes to take next semester. I will commit to coming into the class HOT and coming in with the right attitude. I would also like to put myself out there, with the professor and with other students in the class. That is definitely something I did well in 217.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Overall, I am incredibly proud of myself. I stretched my rubber band for what I thought was possible for me, and I can only go up from here. Time and time again, I've landed at this transcendental life lesson: do hard things to give yourself opportunities to prove your own self-trust, competence, and confidence. These transformative experiences will stack on top of each other to change your self-concept to seeing yourself as someone who LOVES doing hard things and exeeds at everything she puts her mind to. </p>
