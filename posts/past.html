            <p class="ind">I assume if you’re reading this, you’re leveled up enough to know that <strong>negative self-talk is a big NO. </strong> Seriously. It’s a grave thing to do — and I don’t say that lightly.</p>
            
            <p class="ind">Here’s the thing: your brain cannot tell the difference between a joke and the truth. So when you “jokingly” say things about yourself, your brain — your subconscious mind — is still listening. It takes those words as fact. The words you speak, especially about yourself, carry weight. Your word is <em>impeccable</em>, and you need to guard it. That’s not just motivation — that’s neuroscience, psychology, and spiritual reality rolled into one.</p>
            
            <p class="ind">So now that I’ve started with that rant, I want to go deeper.</p>
            
            <p class="ind">Stop hating on your past self.</p>
            
            <p class="ind">It’s not funny to be self-deprecating. Even though it feels like a past life, that person is still YOU. And the way you talk about her — the stories you tell about that version of yourself — that all becomes part of the narrative your brain believes. When you call her “dumb” or “embarrassing,” you are internalizing shame for the very version of yourself that got you here.</p>
            
            <p class="ind">Let me put it in perspective — imagine sitting at a coffee shop with the old version of you. If she was right in front of you, would you talk to her like that? Would you tell her she was stupid? Immature? Clueless?</p>
            
            <p class="ind">I would hope not.</p>
            
            <p class="ind">Because here’s the truth: the life you’re living right now is the <em>culmination</em> of your past self’s choices. You are where you are today because <em>she</em> endured. She made decisions — some brave, some messy — and each one moved the needle forward. </p>
                
            <p class="ind"><strong>She quite literally walked so you could run.</strong></p>
            
            <p class="ind">The reason you are living a much better life than before is because of <em>her</em>. So instead of mocking her, I urge you: honor her. Commend her. Love her. Be grateful for her. She suffered so you wouldn’t have to. She cried so you could smile. She learned lessons so you could live wiser. That is <strong>not</strong> someone to ridicule — that is someone to revere.</p>
            
            <p class="ind">Rewrite that damn story you tell yourself. Don’t say, <em>“I was so dumb back then, I made stupid decisions that I would never make now that I know better.” </em></p>

            <p class="ind">That is so rude.</p>

            <p class="ind">Would you say that to her if she was right in front of you? Would you tell her, <em>“Listen, you are so stupid. Why would you ever think that was a good idea? Do you not know any better?”</em> </p>
            
            <p class="ind">I hope you would never talk to anyone like that, even yourself. Why don’t you instead reframe the story? Speak to her like this:</p>
            
            <p class="ind"><em>“Listen, I want you to remember something. None of us were put on this earth to live a picture-perfect life. We are all living our first shot at life. I’ve made more mistakes than I can count. But every time you’ve fallen, you rose up. You reflected, you learned, and you grew. That is what life is all about. It’s not about never slipping, but about choosing to rise again, and trusting that every step, even the hard ones, are part of something bigger.”</em></p>
            
            <p class="ind"><em>“I know how it feels when everything seems to be against you. When you feel like you have no more strength to give. I know you’ve been there numerous times. But somehow, you’ve always made it through. And that’s no accident — it’s a measure of your strength and resilience.”</em></p>
            
            <p class="ind"><em>“When life dealt you the worst hand, you didn’t give up. Instead of folding, you reshuffled the deck. You found a way to keep going, and I commend your strength. If it wasn’t for your perseverance, vulnerability, and self-reflection, I wouldn’t be where I am today – stronger, wiser, and more grounded.”</em></p>
            
            <p class="ind"><em>“At the end of the day, I’m truly proud of you for everything. We’re not meant to do everything right, but in a world where everyone tries to look flawless, and where every sinner judges other sinners for sinning differently, you showed great courage to keep going even when it was hard. You are strong, you are worthy, and you are so loved. I love you so much. Thank you for everything.”</em></p>
            
            <p class="ind">You have the power to rewrite your story. You don’t need to feed yourself the narrative of “I was so dumb, but now I’m better” — that’s crazy disrespectful to the girl who was just trying to make it through. She was doing her best with what she knew, with what she had, and in the conditions she was placed in. And she still got you here.</p>
            
            <p class="ind"><strong>So give her grace. Give her love. Give her credit.</strong></p>
            
            <p class="ind">You script the story of your life every time you talk about it — so make it a good one.</p>
