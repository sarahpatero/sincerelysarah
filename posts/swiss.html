<p class="subheading">My Long-Awaited Reflection on My Vacation to Switzerland and Germany</p>

<p>I let myself be me. I let myself be open and happy. I let myself be who I am freely. I wore what I wanted, and I put much effort into making sure I look beautiful. I took all the pictures and all the videos my heart pleased.</p> <br>

<p>Seeing this other side of the world was outstanding. I loved Switzerland’s neat combination of city life overlooking stunning naturesque views, like lakes and the Swiss Alps.</p> <br>

<h2>Zurich</h2>
<p>Zurich to me felt a lot more congested. The most luxurious city, and also the most city-like we visited in Switzerland. I loved the quiet luxury of the city—the Burberry umbrella, all the Birkins, the LV or Chanel sunglasses. Zurich was the first place we arrived in, so naturally I was jet-lagged and tired. I didn’t put my best foot forward when it came to my outfits or makeup, and I can clearly see the effects of it because of how I view that part of the vacation. It felt plain, like any other city I could’ve been to in America. *I wasn’t ready to face the city, and the city wasn’t ready to face me.* I wasn’t ready to take it all in and you could see it in my visual appearance.</p> <br>

<p>Also, the weather didn’t do us justice. It was cloudy all the time we spent there, giving the beautiful city a gloomy feel. My favorite part was the Lindt factory.</p> <br>

<h2>Lucerne</h2>
<p>My aura changed once I got to Lucerne. I finally put on some makeup, dressed myself in more than just black flare leggings and my black silk top. And that energy I put forward into my appearance manifested in my attitude towards the city and the way the city greeted me. It was a beautiful, sunny day. The city had the perfect balance of city life and nature, overlooking the vast mountains and much of the city based around a lake.</p> <br>

<p>Chapel Bridge was the flower-infested bridge running across the lake—a breathtaking site making for some stunning photos. We later ate at my favorite restaurant of the entire trip, an Italian restaurant overlooking the lake. The food was incredible, and we all loved the spaetzle. After eating, we walked around the city and I stopped by this clothing stand outside a hidden store in an alleyway. The owners invited me inside to take a closer look, and my gratitude for that moment shows in the fact that I am currently wearing the brown skirt that I bought from there. Stunning, natural fiber, Italian-made pieces that were quietly classy. The service was impeccable, and I even got to show off some of my Italian to the workers. They were lovely. We did some more walking around Lucerne and stopped by this great Lion monument carved into the side of a mountain. The day ended off with Elaine, dad, and I going to a gas station to get some snacks for the night, where I bought a delicious croissant, eating it as I watched the sun set on the way back to the hotel.</p> <br>

<p><strong>July 10th</strong>, in Lucerne, was probably one of my favorite days in Switzerland. We woke up the next morning in Lucerne and went to the train station to get some matcha and a chai latte at this cute bookstore. Then we were on our way to Mt. Pilatus. I couldn’t have chosen a better outfit for this day. I felt stunning, like a beautiful princess sizing mountains that overlooked the entire city. What others would’ve seen is a beautiful view with the Swiss Alps. Lauren, Nichole, Elaine, and I took an exciting cable car ride up the mountain. Nothing could’ve prepared me for the views up here. I had so much fun climbing up and down, taking pictures, and speaking Spanish with other tourists. My physical appearance made me that much more alluring and magnetizing, and you can see it in the photos we took. We ended the day with our last exploration of the city, walking around and visiting a church with a beautifully elaborate ceiling.</p> <br>

<p><strong>July 11th</strong> was our goodbye to Lucerne, and we were escorted out of the city by our Iranian driver, Ali. Our first stop was Interlaken, a quaint, beautiful city with gorgeous views and crystal-blue lakes. He then drove us to a waterfall, where dad and I trekked up only to find NOTHING. But at least dad took some bomb photos of me. Lastly, Ali dropped us off at our home for the next 4 days, Grindelwald.</p> <br>

<h2>Grindelwald</h2>
<p>My favorite city was, no doubt, Grindelwald. No surprise that it was the most nature-encapsulating place we visited. Our hotel was on a mountain overlooking the city, and the balcony viewed straight at the Jungfrau mountains. I could see right in front of me the kind of place I’d dreamed to live in: a mountainous small town populated only with log cabins. *It was here where I found out I had hyperthyroidism. LOL anyways...* our hotel was GORGEOUS, and I got to share a room with mom, dad, Elaine, and often Lauren too. Incredible bonding and fun family-time in that room. The breakfast was simple, which was perfect for me. I started the days off with a few slices of cheese, turkey, tomatoes, yogurt, and milk.</p> <br>

<p><strong>July 12th</strong>—our first real day in Grindelwald—we went up the mountain on a cable car to go on a Toboggan ride. It was actually really short, but soo fun. How fast I went, I’ll never forget that rush as I was descending down at full speed. On round 2, I recorded a video of the ride, which I’ll forever cherish because it perfectly captured my view and the views. After our rides, we met a super social butterfly!!! I found my counterpart!!! She would not leave us alone for a long time, and we made use of that by taking some cute cute pictures with it. I even got to pet and feed this cow. An hour later, we were on a spider web in the middle of a waterfall. We ate at this place called Bubbas. Ended the night off with some Calc 3 homework on the balcony of our hotel.</p> <br>

<p>Woke up the next morning in it for the funnest day ever. We went paragliding!!! I had the best instructor ever, who took the best photos and made sure I had an amazing time. *Lesson learned from here: make people feel comfortable with you, show them your gratitude, and don’t be afraid to ask for more.* I was definitely magnetizing here. We then ate at my second favorite restaurant of the vacation, and we had this cool polyglot waiter. He was outgoing and soo funny. We ate rabbit, goat, and lamb, and no surprise the lamb was the best. Coming back to the hotel this day, we were greeted by a double rainbow. Then, we went out one more time and my dad bought me the most beautiful, stunning, cute watch ever, which I am wearing right now!!!</p> <br>

<h2>Munich</h2>
<p>The next day, I learned a great lesson. We were on the train towards Munich, and these people were in our spots. What I learned is that you need to be blunt and speak up for yourself. Period. We lodged at Hampton Inn, which pleasantly met our American standards for hotels. Even though Munich was a lackluster city, I could really feel the family love and camaraderie at this point in the vacation. We had a great time wherever we went because we just loved each other’s company. The first night, we ate at this burger place that Elaine recommended, which surprisingly exceeded our expectations. The food and service were incredible. We spent lots of time laughing at this meme too, so cute. The breakfast at this hotel was sooo good, and on our way into the city, Lauren was reading a book with the girl next to her, so cute <333</p> <br>

<p>While I was stunned by the view that welcomed me when I first ascended from the subway station in Munich, I later concluded that Munich was just like any other city. And the people are much more brash in Germany I found. Less apt to help tourists, and don’t mess with their bike lanes because they will run you over.</p> <br>

<p>Our second day in Munich, we strolled around the Marienplatz again, and I wore my beautiful brown Anthropologie dress. I tried on clothes from the brand that now has me in a chokehold: Rosemunde. We had lunch at this surprisingly delicious Bavarian restaurant, probably third favorite restaurant just because the service couldn’t have been better. Then we walked around some more in Marienplatz, and later took the train to the BMW museum, and the Olympic Central where the games were held in Munich in 1972.</p> <br>

<p>My last day in Munich, we walked around Marienplatz once again. I met Peter Sax Grigorian this day lol.</p> <br>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>When people asked me how I liked my vacation, I always told them <em>“I am a new person after that vacation. Everyone has to re-get to know me now.”</em> Until now, almost two months since that vacation started, I still feel new, I still feel changed, and I’m living out the evolution that took place in me now.</p> <br>
