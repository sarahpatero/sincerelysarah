          <p><em>"Never forget who you are"</em> were the last words of Ray Garraty's father before he was executed in front of his family by a tyrannical government regime that punished individuality. That moment in the movie <em>The Long Walk</em> echoed a grave lesson: life is not worth living if you are not being authentically who you are, and to Ray Garraty's father, it was worth dying for. </p>
          <br>
          <p>The first year of college was the saddest year of my life. Up until this point, I had gone to every extreme to preserve my individuality and fought to always live authentically to me. Growing up, I'd always been the odd ball beacuse I wasn't afraid to live out loud. But for some strange reason, all of this vigor to unapologetically be myself vanished. The commitment to being myself was overshadowed by the desire to be liked.</p>
        <br>
          <p>I spent my freshman year in college trying on all these different identities like a costume, not because I genuinely wanted to explore, but because I thought being a chameleon to fit in with all sorts of people would make me likable.</p>
          <br>
          <p>So what happened? Did I actually make any friends? Absolutely not. Because the energy of inaunthenticity will speak for you before you even get a chance. People will subconsciously read you, and know there is something off. People unknowingly know when you are trying to be someone you're not.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I forgot who I was. I forgot who Sarah was, but my heart still knew. That's why it ached every time I acted out of character, each time chipping away at my confidence. The message that I was communicating with myself unknowingly was "You are not good enough to be yourself, you have to put on a mask". </p>
