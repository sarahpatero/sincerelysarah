          <p>Sometimes I imagine my life if I was already good at everything and had no need to struggle through hard times. Sometimes I look at other people and I envy what they have, which seems like life handed to them on a silver platter. Or sometimes I get down on myself for making mistakes and compare myself with others who are seemingly perfect. But I have to pause and ask myself:</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Would you rather pursue only what you are good at, or pursue what truly interests you? </strong></p>
          <br>
          <p>How fun would your life be if you were just good at everything right off the bat, and you had no struggle with anything? It might be fun (I wouldn't know), but what I can ask is, when do you learn how to perservere? When do you learn how to work through hard things?</p>
          <br>
          <p>The need for perfection is holding you back from not going after what you truly want to pursue.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Everyone struggles when they first start something. But the point of it all is who you become in the process of that struggle. You become someone who knows how to work hard, how to chase relentlessly after what they want, and you prove to yourself that you can do anything that you set your mind to.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I have a question for you.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Who do you become when you only do what you're already good at?</strong></p>
          <br>
          <p>Suppose I only decided to pursue what I am already good at. I would have closed myself off to the world's possibilities and gifts. I would have never given longboarding a try, and if I never did that, so many cherished memories, from longboarding with my friends or going on mile-long treks around my city would've never happened. I would've never took a random girl's hand and lead her around a track in my college town, forming a core memory for me and her as we laughed along the trail. All the life that I would've missed out on!!</p>
         <br>
          <p>If I only did what I was good at, I would never take any risks. I would've been too afriad of being seen trying or being seen failing. But the person that I've become through any trials and even more errors is someone who is persistent and perserveres. Life is not always going to be easy, and you can prepare yourself for the brunts of life by showing yourself that you can persist through. The obstacles you face are numerous, but it's like you have been preparing for Ninja Warrior this entire time.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>So I pose my last question to you, what have you not started yet because you are still waiting to be "ready"?</strong></p>
          <br>
          <p>I'll be the one to break it to you, you will NEVER feel ready. Listen to anyone who achieved beyond their wildest dreams. They will all tell you that they had to just take the shot in the dark. And guess what, that's already half the battle because most people never even try. </p>
          <br>
          <p>You may not achieved what you had planned, but you will never fail in becoming wiser and stronger afterwards. And maybe that's the real win: not arriving reading, but becoming someone who is brave enough to begin anyway.</p>
