<p>I was in my last class of the semester. I sat in the back, not listening to the lecture, instead writing feverishly on a page meant for notes. <em>“Sarah, why do you do everything that you do? Why are you here at the University of Michigan? Who do you want to be when you leave college?” </em> I wrote at the top of the page.</p><br>

<p><em>“You have three semesters left. I need you to live a new life each month. You’re being too willy-nilly with your time.”</em></p><br>

<p>At that point, I couldn’t have told you anything meaningful that had happened that semester. And it wasn't because nothing meaningful had happened, it was because I wasn't taking the time to properly digest my life. I had been so immersed in school, school, school, that I forgot I was also not just a student. I was a multi-dimensional human being with hobbies, passions, friends, and goals outside of academics. Somewhere along the way, I got lost in it all.</p><br>

<p>Every waking hour felt like tasks stacked on top of tasks, and I was moving through life on autopilot.</p><br>

<p>I couldn’t tell you what I ate for breakfast yesterday. I didn’t have any solid routine anchoring my days. I was just going through the motions. This wasn’t the kind of life I wanted to live at all.</p><br>

<p><em>“Who do you want to be? What do you want? Who do you have to be to gain everything you want?”</em> I asked myself. The lines that followed were honest, raw visions of the woman I dreamed of becoming. <em>“Energetic. Content. Confident. Luxurious. Secure.” </em>The list went on. <em> “I envision my highest self thriving in an environment where she feels safe to be herself.”</em></p><br>

<p><em>“What lights you on fire? What gives you energy when you think about it?” </em> I continued. <em> “I want to do good for people and the world. I do best teaching others and helping people gain confidence in their abilities.” </em> The lines that followed touched on possible career paths, all connected by a single thread: teaching and helping people step into the best versions of themselves.</p><br>

<p><em>“How can I become her?” </em> I asked. <em>“I envision that version of Sarah as disciplined, stoic yet enthusiastic, hungry for knowledge…” </em> I went on and on, imagining her so vividly that I could feel her coming alive in my heart.</p><br>

<p>The purpose of my life is to serve people—specifically by helping others reach their full potential.</p><br>

<p>Ever since that day—when I wrote as if there were a fire lit under my pen—I’ve felt a million times better about my life and where I am right now. Instead of going through the motions, I connect everything I’m doing to how it will help me become the woman I want to be. I move through my days asking myself, “How can I get closer to her?” or “What can I do for the world today that aligns with my true purpose?”</p><br>

<p>I didn’t need a grand gesture to start embodying her. I just honored the fact that this desire existed within me. And that made all the difference.</p><br>

<p><em>“I always come back to the same truth about myself. I’ve always known I wanted to help people, but not in a doctor way, or a lawyer way, or a politician way. I love seeing real, tangible, meaningful, lasting impact on those I meet, specifically in their confidence. I want people to leave me feeling happier, more confident, and more capable.”</em></p><br>

<p>Once I put this into writing, it became a million times easier to step into my purpose. Becoming laser-focused on what truly sets my heart on fire is already half the journey.</p><br>
<p>So I encourage anyone feeling like your life just put into a blender and mixed together senselessly, take some time to breathe, sit down, and journal about what you believe you were truly meant for, and how you can embody that purpose in everything you do.</p>
