        <p>No genuinely. When do you ever make time to sit down and take it all in. The veins in a leaf, the individual blades of grass. A squirrel eating an acorn. The miracle of life, the miracle of being on planet Earth. All there is is right in front of you, and you don’t even care. </p> <br>
        <p>Too busy scrolling on that damn phone. Too busy planning for nothing. Too busy worrying about a future that doesn’t even exist yet, or replaying a past that’s already done. </p> <br>
        <p>Be careful, the sacred simplicity of the now is going to pass you by!!!</p> <br>
        <p>The breeze that brushes against your face like a kiss from God. The wind came from all the way across the country just to hit your cheek. You didn’t even hear the message that the wind spoke to you. </p> <br>
        <p>The sunlight pouring through your window like warm honey. I swear to you, there is no greater feeling that the sun on your skin. Slightly cooking you, warming you outside in. </p> <br>
        <p>The way your chest rises and falls without you asking it to. Did you stop to think. You have a heartbeat that just keeps choosing you, moment after moment. </p> <br>
        <p>My love, when did existing stop being enough?</p> <br>
        <p>When did you forget that you’re part of this earth, not separate from it? Think of this. The mass of the earth will never change. Since the beginning of the Earth, it was in the plan that you would eventually walk here and exist, there was just enough weight in the earth for you to be here TODAY. You’re a breathing miracle made of stardust and softness, neurons and nuance, capable of noticing beauty. And being beauty.</p> <br>
        <p>The fruits that you’ve eaten, they were meant for you the day you were planted. They were written in your roots before you even knew how to grow. Before the storms, before the droughts, before the long, silent seasons where nothing seemed to bloom- they were already yours. </p> <br>
        <p>The sweetness was always coming, it just needed time. Time to build strength underground. Time to shed what no longer served you. Time to be stretched by the sun and shaped by the wind. </p> <br>
        <p>Sit down, Be still, Watch the world in its quiet brilliance. </p> <br>
        <p>Stop searching for answers. Stop searching at all!!!</p> <br>
        <p>Because maybe the only thing you’re really missing, is your own attention.</p> <br>
        <p>Give it back. Give it back to the sky, to the trees. To the life that never stopped blooming around you—even when you stopped looking. </p> <br>
