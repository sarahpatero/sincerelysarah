        <p class="ind">	The love in my heart after that final run could barely contain itself. It was trying to come out of my body, causing me to project my chest out, hold my chin high, and paste a beaming smile across my face. Although I just had an incredible run, I knew that the satisfaction I felt wasn’t from a perfect run, but a perfect season. It came from the continuous and relentless effort I put in for the past 4 months. Where every rehearsal, I performed like it was my last, like I was performing to my dearest ones. </p>
        <p class ="ind">I was closing the chapter on the season that subliminally shifted my identity. Unrecognizable, oozing confidence. A whole different human being from last year. Worlds different. From a different dimension. Who even was I??? Who have I become??? Someone I absolutely love to be. A captivating performer. Someone so sure of herself. Who grew to act freely without being so afraid of being judged or maintaining a perfect image. Willing to be perceived authentically than to not be perceived at all. The magnitude of this growth was outstanding. </p>
        <p class ="ind">Everything happened so subtly. Behind the scenes, in my subconscious mind, I was evolving into the most confident version of myself. On the outside, I started to walk differently, with a fascinating rhythm. I carried my chest high at all times, with a strict and straight posture. And I had a persistent smile on my face. On the inside, I fell in love with being me. </p>
        <p class ="ind">Let me talk physicality. I didn’t show up to a single rehearsal where my hair, makeup, and outfit were not all on point. This helped me perform with the utmost confidence at every rehearsal. I showed up ready to rock the floor. I looked good, so I felt good, so I performed amazingly. But more importantly, my beauty became an internal light, a spiritual radiance that beaming from my core. I felt an energetic field shining from my heart center, and I acted out of life-force energy. The kind of flow we get into where we are so happy, everything feels easy. </p> 
        <p class ="ind">I knew the ropes. I had a season under my belt already. I knew what to expect, so I knew how to surpass those expectations. I noticed what the team lacked, and in my opinion, it was confidence, posture, facial expressions, ease of movement. So I became the epitome of embodying all of those features. I grew to exceed all of those performance standards. I may not have been the most-skilled flag, but I sure was a sight to see. I was like a fireball on the floor, all eyes drawn to me. </p>
        <p class ="ind">I might not be the best, but I know I can do anything I put my mind to and I know I’m going to look damn good doing it. There are no limits to what I can do. Everything I wanted to do, I did. Everything I wanted to be, I became. I didn’t grow much in my skills, but my container for what I know is possible for me expanded very much, allowing me to see what’s possible for other people showed me what’s possible for me. </p>
        <p class ="ind">I let myself be myself instead of putting on a persona. Last year, I wanted to be cool, hot, mysterious, quiet. Not a bad vibe to have at all, but it’s not MINE. It’s not authentic to me. So what happened as a result when I acted like that all last season? I basically forgot the season even existed because what truly matters: growing as a person and building strong relationships, I couldn’t achieve. I was acting like someone else, so the real me didn’t get any chance to show in order to grow and develop. There was no novel change in me. And because I acted like I was shy and mysterious when I’m NOT, I made no new friends and built no strong relationships. This was such a bummer looking back. I did such a disservice to myself. I’m meant to be out there, outgoing, extroverted, and outwardly happy. </p>
        <p class ="ind">To end this off, I just want to take a moment to reflect on how unexpected life can get. You truly never know where you’ll end up, what you’ll be up to in the future. You could’ve never told ninth grade Sarah that one day, she would trade playing saxophone in the marching band for spinning in the colorguard. Eleventh Sarah would’ve never knew she would start a collegiate marching band career as a FLAG instead of a saxophone, let alone even get into her dream college. And twelfth grade Sarah, on her last day of her last competition as a senior in marching band, would’ve never believed she would continue her passion in the biggest stadium in the USA. Third grade Sarah? She took violin lessons for two years just to switch to saxophone in fifth grade. She played saxophone all of middle school and made the fondest of memories in middle school band. Marching band became her entire personality in high school. And even now, it still is. </p>
        <p class ="ind">I’m proud of you, Sarah, for how far you’ve come. I’m excited to see all the places you’ll go. </p>
