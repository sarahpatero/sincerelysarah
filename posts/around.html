        <p>Back against the wall, she slid down to crouch in the corner of her room. Senior-year Sarah found herself completely alone.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Earlier that day, the only friend that she had left in her life was driving her home. On her way to the car, she was being taunted by people for, yet another, terrible decision that she made. And thank the universe for the conversation she was about to have with her close friend.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We had been close friends for three years now. We watched each other grow into who we were, albeit the version of me that I had become at that point definitely needed some...guidance.</p>
        <br>
        <p>"This is too much, Sarah. If this kind of behavior continues, I will not be in your life anymore," he told me with a stoic voice. The bubbly, smiley version of me was nowhere to be found. We sat in silence, because I knew that my voice would break at the next word that would come out of my mouth </p>
        <br>
        <p>"You can turn your life around." He said as he pulled into my driveway to drop me off. </p>
        <br>
        <p>The period of my life that followed that day wasn't out of a fairytale. I turned inward. I went to school and became hyperaware of all the signs that people disliked me. How people would switch tables immediately when I sat next to them. When people would pull forward from their parking spot after I parked next to them. I saw it all. My closest friends felt ashamed of me, and it felt like everyone was in on my business and joined the Sarah-hate bandwagon.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I was involuntarily alone. </p>
