        <p>Back against the wall, she slid down to crouch in the corner of her room. Senior-year Sarah found herself completely alone.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The life I was living was nowhere near a fairytale. At school, I'd become hyperaware of all the signs that people disliked me. How people would switch tables immediately when I sat next to them. When people would pull forward from their parking spot after I parked next to them. I saw it all. My closest friends felt ashamed of me, and it felt like everyone was in on my business and joined the Sarah-hate bandwagon.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I was involuntarily alone.</p>
        <br>
        <p>After my senior-year homecoming dance, there were more rumors that popped up about me, involving a boy that I had talked to the night of homecoming. Certain people saw it and wanted to make a scene.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I went to school the next day and confronted the homecoming guy. I thought I was going to slam him for saying such disrespectful things, but we both quickly found out that we had both been set up and nothing that anyone had said was actually true.</p>
        <br>
        <p>After I calmed down, we had a candid conversation, walking outside our school underneath this tree that I now see as so special because of this day.</p>
        <br>
        <p>He was practically a complete stranger, but I opened up to him about how much I was sick of everything. Sick of the way that people were treating me, but more so at this point, sick of myself. The shame and realization that I had gone down a dark path had finally hit me. I told him all about how I wanted to change, and that I was trying to start being better. And to my utter surprise, he told me that he never believed any of the things that people were saying about me. </p>
        <br>
        <p>"We may have never been friends, but I've watched you closely ever since freshman year. I know you are truly a special girl. I've seen you do many impressive things, and you have my full faith that you can do something that'll wow me away just one more time. <em>You can turn your life around. </em>"</p>
        <br>
        <p>Is it cliché to say that my life completely changed after that conversation? Because it absolutely did. After months of being tormented, someone had told me that they still saw some good in me. Someone told me that they believed in me for the better. And that made all the difference. In hindsight, I would never be where I am today had that conversation never taken place.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>You can turn your life around.</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>I'm seriously not kidding. After that day, it's like my life did a complete 180. Day by day, I was slowly growing out of the destructive person that I had become. I got a gym membership at a luxury gym surrounded by high-quality people, I got my first job as a waitress, and I completely locked in on my classes and passions outside of school.</p>
        <br>
        <p>All the while, my internal beliefs and mindsets were changing rapidly. I was healing my damaging behaviors, and becoming calloused against any hatred that came towards me. I may not have had a vision of who exactly I wanted to become yet, but the belief that I was going to make something great of myself kept me mentally strong. </p>
