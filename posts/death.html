          <p>Until you die, your defeat, your failing is all in your head.</p>
          <br>
          <p>You are still alive, you are still moving. Your hands can move. Your legs can move. You are completely capable of trying again and going again, trying for your 200th time. </p>
          <br>
          <p>You're not dead, you're not immobile. You're perfectly fine. You just have to try again. Because until you die, defeat is all in your head. It's all about how you look at it. It's all in your mind.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Keep trying over, and over, and over, until you physically can't move. Because guess what, some people don't get the chance to try again.</p>
          <br>
          <p>But you are alive. You are very well and alive. So guess what? You have another chance. So why not take it?</p>
          <br>
          <p>Get back up.</p>
