          <p class="ind">In a world obsessed with being known, ask yourself -<em>known for what?</em></p>
          <p class="ind">For how we look?</p>
          <p class="ind">For the circle we sit in?</p>
          <p class="ind">For how many people double-tap our instagram posts?</p>
          <br>
          <p class="ind">What makes someone <em>truly</em> worth knowing is their <strong>depth</strong>. Their ability to make you feel seen. Their consistency when no one's watching. The way they show up with quiet wisdom and leave you better than they found you.</em></p>
          <p class="subheading">The Miracle of You</p>
          <p class="ind">8 billion people walk this earth. Every single one of them made of the same atoms, same biology, yet no two are alike. There was a one in a 1 trillion chance of you being alive, and I’m watching you waste your life away. </p>
        <p class="ind">You were given this amazing life, all the opportunities are laid in front of you on a silver platter. And you have no hobbies, you’re not learning anything, and you’re passionate about nothing.  </p>
                
        <p class="ind">There was a nearly impossible chance of you ever being born. And yet… here you are. Alive. Conscious. Breathing. Able to feel, move, change, create, dream. But if you’re being honest, are you actually <i>living</i>?</p>
        
        <p class="ind">You were given this life. This <b>miracle</b> of a life.  
        And yet, you're sitting in it half-asleep — scrolling mindlessly, avoiding discomfort, stalling your growth. You’re not creating. You’re not learning. You’re not pouring into the parts of yourself that are longing for more.</p>
        
        <p class="ind">And I’m not judging you.  
        But I <i>am</i> begging you, don’t waste it.</p>
        
        <p class="subheading">Strive for Depth, Not Perfection</p>
        
        <p class="ind">I’m not asking you to be perfect. Strive to be genuine instead. Have substance. People won’t remember the superficial things, like the brand of clothing you wore, or when you fumbled your words. They’ll remember how safe, seen, or inspired they felt around you. And that kind of impression? That’s built through depth – compassion, wisdom, honesty, humility. </p>
                        
        <p class="subheading">You Were Meant for More</p>
        <p class="ind">I just want you to be more. You could be so much more than you are and it’s hurting me to see you not realize it. There’s so much to do in this life. Remember, you woke up this morning while someone else took their last breath. I don’t want you to waste your life anymore. I want you to make something of yourself.</p>

        
        <p class="ind">I know there’s a fire in you.  
        Maybe it’s quiet now. Maybe life has tried to smother it.  
        But deep down, there’s something you’ve always wanted. Something big. Something beautiful. Something that could change your whole trajectory if you let it.</p>
        
        <p class="ind">What’s stopping you?</p>
        
        <p class="ind">Maybe it’s fear. Maybe it’s doubt. Maybe it’s comfort.</p>
        
        <p class="ind">But you have to understand — the world <i>needs</i> you at your full potential.  
        You were made in the image of God. You are not random.  
        Your life is not meaningless.</p>
        
        <p class="ind"><i>God has a reason you’re here.  
        God has a plan that only you can fulfill.</i></p>
        
        <p class="ind">So don’t sleep on yourself. Don’t numb yourself with distractions. Don’t let life pass you by while you’re stuck waiting for the “right moment” that never comes.</p>
        
        <p class="ind">You woke up this morning.  
        Someone else didn’t.</p>
        
        <p class="ind"><b>That’s your sign.</b></p>
        
        <p class="subheading">Get it Together</p>
        <p class="ind">Here’s a quick list of actionable steps and habits you can start implementing into your life NOW to start helping yourself:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <p class="ind"><b>Take deep breaths.</b> When your chest tightens, when anxiety hits, when you feel the lump in your throat — breathe in. Then let it all go. Make this your default response to stress. Let your body reset.</p>
          <p class="ind"><b>Fix your posture.</b> Keep your shoulders back. Sit upright. Make space between your ears and shoulders. Confidence is a physical practice.</p>
          <p class="ind"><b>Put the phone down.</b> When you’re bored, don’t default to distraction. Just <i>be</i>. Sit with yourself. Let your brain process. Give yourself space to exist without stimulation.</p>
          <p class="ind"><b>Prioritize hygiene.</b> Clean your mouth after meals. Wash your face and hands often. Shower more frequently. Freshen your sheets and your clothes. You’ll feel lighter.</p>
          <p class="ind"><b>Eat real food.</b> Eat the rainbow — fruits, veggies, meats, whole foods. Feed your body something that fuels life, not drains it.</p>
          <p class="ind"><b>Lead with compassion.</b> Stop judging everything. Start assuming the best in others. See the child in people. Choose an open heart every time.</p>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="subheading">Be impossible to explain.</p>
        <p class="ind">Let your depth confuse people who only know how to look at surfaces.  
        Be someone worth knowing — because you chose to live with meaning.</p>
        <p class="ind">Your life is not an accident.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Remember.</p>
<p class="ind">You are not too far behind. You are not too late. Start where you are. With what you have. And just be someone worth knowing.</p>

<p class="ind">Someone who brings peace. Someone who holds space. Someone who walks with grace and strength and softness all at once.</p>

<p class="ind">The world needs more of that. And it needs you to show up.</p>
