            <p>Who are you when no one is watching?</p>
            <p >I think of integrity as staying true to your hgihest self. Being unwaveringly honest, and doing the right thing no matter what. Somebody is ALWAYS watching you. You. You are the most careful person you have to be around. Acting out of character in front of yourself is detrimental. </p>  
            <p>Why Sarah? I should be comfortable with myself and comfortable to let loose and act how I want. Every single action that unaligns with who you want to be takes a toll on your confidence. Each time, you break off a small piece of trust that you once had in yourself. Keep showing yourself that you can't be trusted, and your self-confidence will be nowhere in sight. Showing yourself that YOU can trust yourself, that YOU WILL act in accordance to your values and what you believe is good is vastly important for our self-concept.</p>
            <p>You can say all the affirmations you want. You can try deluding yourself into confidence, but your brain keeps the score. All the moments where you acted without integrity take a toll on your subconscious image of yourself. Your brain remembers always, and will render you as someone not to be trusted. The brain is always watching you.</p>
            <p>In my intro level psychology class, we learned about cognitive dissonance: when your internal beliefs don't match the external, it creates discomfort, and either your beliefs will change to meet your exernal reality, or your externality reality will meet your internal beliefs will. It means that you can't put on a facade without causing damage to yourself. Acting like your a good person and avoiding your lack of integrity will come back to bite you. So start calling yourself out. Gain self-awareness to see when you act out of line, and do your best to change your behavior in the future. </p>
