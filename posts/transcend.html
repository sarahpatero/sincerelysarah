<p class="ind"><strong>The false promise of external solutions to an internal longing.</strong></p>

<p class="ind">Travelling to other countries to <em>“find yourself”</em> is a <strong>GIMMICK</strong>. It’s a <strong>cope</strong>!!! You’re not searching, you’re escaping!!! You are actually just avoiding your own life, looking for something outside of yourself to fill the void you feel. That void can be filled <strong>right here, right now</strong>, in your everyday life.</p>

<p class="ind">So cancel that ticket to Bali, or Greece. That void is waiting for you to sit down, <strong>BE QUIET</strong>, and <strong>listen</strong>.</p>

<p class="ind"><em>Let me guess…</em></p>

<p class="ind">I have a feeling that you feel the need to justify your “awakening” with a grand gesture, masking it behind a huge life event so that you can have an excuse to finally become who you want to be. Are you waiting for a breakup? A tattoo? A sunrise yoga session in a place where no one knows your name?</p>

<p class="ind"><strong>Well, I have a feeling that you already know EXACTLY how to become her</strong>—the girl who feels divine, certain, and aligned. You know where the switch is in your head, and all you have to do is <strong>flip it</strong>.</p>

<p class="ind">I’m all for romanticizing life and making your life as special and extraordinary as possible. But if you are holding yourself back because you feel you need to justify this higher version of yourself with a grand opening, <strong>THAT’S WHERE I DRAW THE LINE.</strong> Stop holding yourself hostage!</p>

<p class="ind"><strong>PLEASE. STOP.</strong></p>

<p class="ind"><strong>At any given moment, remember this:</strong> your life, in the exact way you’re living it, is already a <strong>customized blueprint</strong> for your soul to achieve the highest version of itself. Every piece of your ordinary day is <strong>sacred architecture</strong>. At any given moment, you can be her <strong>RIGHT NOW</strong>.</p>

<p class="ind"><strong>PUT THE BOOK DOWN, TURN OFF THE PODCAST, CANCEL THE GETAWAY TRIP FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF “FINDING THE MEANING OF LIFE.”</strong></p>

<p class="ind"><strong>IT’S NOT BURIED IN A COURSE OR WHISPERED BY A GURU.</strong></p>

<p class="ind">No no no no girl, transcendence, the spiritual awakening you’re looking for that will suddenly make your life feel full of ease and happiness is a <strong>conscious choice</strong> you can start making <strong>right now</strong>.</p>

<p class="ind">It’s in the way you get out of bed, the way you breathe, blink, and love your neighbor. <strong>Transcendence is not elsewhere, it’s in the ordinary.</strong></p>

<p class="ind">Change your perspective. Transcendence doesn’t come outside of you during a novel experience. It comes from the ordinary. The mundanity.</p>

<p class="ind">Shift your gaze. Train your eyes to see how there are <strong>miracles EVERYWHERE</strong>, if you would just <strong>STOP AND LOOK</strong>. Reframe your vision to see how everything is miraculous. <strong>Everything is love, everything is life.</strong> Live in the lightest timeline. Go about life with an open heart full of love, and with an open mind that understands and carries great compassion.</p>

<p class="ind">Your life <strong>RIGHT NOW</strong> is <strong>SO special</strong> as it is. <strong>The time is NOW!</strong> <strong>NOW.</strong> <strong>YOUR LIFE IS NOT WAITING FOR YOU, YOUR LIFE IS NOW SARAH!!!</strong></p>

<p class="ind">Don’t deny the best version of yourself the life that she wants to live. <strong>TODAY IS SPECIAL.</strong> <strong>CHOOSE TODAY AS THE DAY WHERE YOU FINALLY BECAME YOUR DREAM SELF.</strong> <strong>TODAY.</strong> <strong>YOU ARE THE BEST VERSION OF YOURSELF TODAY.</strong> <strong>YOU MADE IT!!!</strong></p>

<p class="ind"><strong>CONGRATULATIONS GIRL!!!</strong></p>

<p class="ind">People pour their energy outward in a fatal attempt to “ascend.” What if you focused all that energy <strong>INWARD</strong> instead? Instead of trying to uncover all the miracles of the universe so you finally have the knowledge necessary to ascend, <em>have you considered diving deep into yourself instead?</em></p>

<p class="ind"><em>What if all the wisdom that you are searching for, your intuition already knows it?</em> You just need to <strong>listen to her</strong>!</p>

<p class="ind"><strong>The microcosm mirrors the macrocosm.</strong> You are a <strong>reflection of the universe itself</strong>.</p>

<p class="ind">Just as the universe is vast and full of mystery, <strong>so are you</strong>. Every answer you're searching for—every ounce of wisdom, peace, clarity—it already exists <strong>within you</strong>.</p>

<p class="ind">You don't need to explore the far corners of the world to find truth. <strong>Try exploring your inner world instead.</strong></p>

<p class="ind">You are not separate from the universe—<strong>you are the universe, in human form.</strong></p>

<p class="ind">So if the cosmos holds infinite wonder, then <strong>so do you</strong>.</p>

<p class="ind"><strong>Return to yourself, and you’ll find that the home, the healing, and the miracle you’ve been chasing was never far at all.</strong></p>

<p class="ind"><strong>Stop searching for the light outside of you—because you’ve been glowing this whole time.</strong></p>
