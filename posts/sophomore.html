        <p class= "ind"><em>“Show me how good it can get.”</em></p>
        <br>
        <p class="ind">To summarize my sophomore year of college in one word: <strong>up</strong>.  </p>
        <p class="ind">Best year of my damn life and I will FOREVER be grateful. This year will live on in my heart forever and ever. And it’s all because of one thing:
        <p class ="ind"><em>The comeback is always greater than the setback</em> </p>
        <p class="ind">I did so many new things, met so many new people, grew so much. I could cry thinking about how amazing this year went for me. And to even think that from here, it only gets better. Completely raised the bar for what I know is possible.  </p>
        <p class="ind">Now to take a moment to reflect on my biggest lessons learned… </p>
        <br>
        <p class="ind"> <strong>1.	Speak your mind and defend yourself ruthlessly.</strong> </p>
        <p class="ind">Stand up for yourself when the time calls for it. Now, there are times and places where you just have to accept the circumstances you’re in, but there are also times where your voice critically matters. Sometimes, what seems like the final say, isn’t the final say. What seems to be finished, may not be finished until you speak up! </p>
        <p class="ind">So, if you notice unjust circumstances against yourself, STAND UP FOR YOURSELF. Put people in their place and speak your mind. Let your voice be heard when it matters most.  </p>
        <p class="ind"> <strong>2.	And in the same vein, know when it’s best to stay quiet.</strong> </p>
        <p class="ind">If someone gives a gift to you, and you don’t accept that gift, to whom does that gift belong to? To them. </p>
        <p class="ind">Some things are just not worth your time, energy, or attention. You’re better off leaving it to fizzle out than to fuel the fire. It takes a great deal of the skill of mental resilience to be able to ignore things and leave things be at your own discernment. </p>
        <p class="ind">I would recommend practicing this level of emotional control whenever it serves you best, and it will eventually become instinctual. Emotional regulation is truly a superpower. </p>
        <p class="ind"><strong>3.	Work hard at everything you do. </strong></p>
        <p class="ind">Confidence builds when you prove to yourself you can handle challenges and improve over time. Prove to yourself that you can do hard things, and that competency will breed confidence. </p>
        <p class="ind">Looking back, I wish I worked harder in my classes this year. I could’ve performed much better, and learned much more. I also wish I worked harder at my first year in collegiate marching band. 
        <p class="ind">In both of these circumstances, I let myself sit in the fact that in just doing what was expected was "already doing so much." I have to be careful of falling into this trap, because there is always some stema left to blow.</p>
        <p class="ind">“I gave it my all and I have nothing left.” You know how good that feeling is after completing something hard, and I wish I chased it more often instead of being happy with mediocrity. </p>
        <p class="ind"><strong> 4.	Don’t dwell over things you can’t control.</strong></p>
        <p class="ind"> Why am I saying this? Because I had a disgusting tan from marching band week and I got sunburnt. I hated the tan so much, but I just said <em>“hey, there is nothing I can do to change this tan. Let me just accept that it completely discolored half of my face.” </em></p>
        <p class="ind">I also tried looking on the bright side, and saw how this tan is a symbol of how much fun I had during band week and of the new season ahead. It signifies me working hard outside everyday, learning new things and getting better. I was tan from doing something so demanding, and I am proud of myself for stepping out my comfort zone.</p>
        <p class="ind">Another anecdote, I got a terrible haircut in November. It was too short, and I’d been trying to grow my hair for years. But then I said to myself <em>“Hey. Hair grows back.” </em> And I stopped being sad about it like I'd just flipped a switch in my head. Because also, so many people in the world WISH they had the ability to grow hair. Sometimes it helps to just compare yourself to others in the world, not to invalidate your feelings, but to put things in perspective. </p>
        <p class="ind">This ability also takes a great deal of emotional control, and eventually, it becomes as easy as turning off a switch in your brain. This skill can become instantaneous through persistent practice of mental fortitude. </p>
        <p class="ind"><strong>5.	Savor your days.</strong></p>
        <p class="ind">My motto for this year:<em> NEVER FORGET YOUR LIFE. </em></p>
        <p class="ind">Take infinite pictures, write all the notes, take any measure to make sure you hold onto the memories. These days are so precious, and you’ll want to look back on them with gratitude. </p>
        <p class="ind"><strong>6.	Learn to love solitude. </strong> </p>
        <p class="ind">Remember, at the end of the day, you're all you got man. There is so much power in loving being by yourself more than being with other people. You should yourself that you are able to stand on your two feet, and if the ship crashes, you can save yourself.</p>
        <p class="ind">Realize that, you're never really alone when you have yourself. When you become best friends with yourself, enjoy your own company, and love your own solitude, there comes a safety in your heart that someone will always have your back no matter what.</p>
        <p class="ind">Strive to get to know yourself better than anyone else on the planet. Take your alone time to maximize all your stats. Become the BEST version you should be, and become ADDICTED to growth and self-love.</p>
        <p class="ind"><strong>7. Get the fuck out there. Seek novelty.</strong></p>
        <p class="ind">VARIETY IS THE SPICE OF LIFE. DO NEW THINGS. GO TO NEW CLUBS. MEET NEW PEOPLE. WEAR NEW OUTFITS. EVERYTHING. LOOK FOR NOVELTY AND NEWNESS EVERYWHERE. It will keep life exciting and yourself growing.</p>
        <p class="ind"><strong>8. Experience time dilation by doing new things.</strong></p>
        <p class="ind">The more present you are, the slower time feels. Do NEW things. Make new memories. It’s how you slow down time and savor life.</p>
        <p class="ind"><strong>9. Be yourself.</strong></p>
        <p class="ind">The people who like you will like you. The people who don’t aren’t meant for you. So don’t waste energy changing yourself for others. Be authentic, and your people will find you.</p>
        <p class="ind"><strong>10. The work you put in will always show up in the result you get.</strong></p>
        <p class="ind">Why am I saying this? I put in no work in my international finance class—I got the grade I deserved. Same with macroeconomics. You can’t fake effort. You get what you give.</p>
        <p class="ind"><strong>11. Show up as your best, hottest self as much as you can.</strong></p>
        <p class="ind">Put effort into yourself. Dress well. Carry yourself with confidence. You deserve to feel like the main character.</p>
        <p class="ind"><strong>12. Furthermore, do activities that make you feel hot, sexy, and confident.</strong></p>
        <p class="ind">Winterguard as fuck. Do what makes you feel like the most radiant version of yourself. That confidence spills over into every area of life.</p>
        <p class="ind"><strong>13. Everything is better with people.</strong></p>
        <p class="ind">Eat with people. Go to the gym with people. Study with people. Walk with people. Connection is what makes life meaningful.</p>
        <p class="ind"><strong>14. Be genuinely excited to see people in your life.</strong></p>
        <p class="ind">Show love. Show joy. Let people feel that you’re happy to see them—it strengthens bonds and uplifts everyone.</p>
        <p class="ind"><strong>15. Listen to your heart and intuition.</strong></p>
        <p class="ind">If your heart has been yelling at you to do something, stop trying to rationalize it. Just do it. Your heart and gut know. Your brain will try to overthink, but don’t let it win.</p>
        <p class="ind">Ask yourself: what do I want? The first answer that comes to mind—go with it.</p>
        <p class="ind"><strong>15. Talk to your professors and build rapport early.</strong></p>
        <p class="ind">Connect with them throughout the semester—not just when you need something. Build relationships. It makes a difference.</p>
        <p class="ind"><strong>16. Go to class.</strong></p>
        <p class="ind">You’re paying how much to go to U of M? And you’re skipping class to sleep? Unacceptable. Build your schedule around showing up. Period.</p>
        <p class="ind"><strong>17. Be a free spirit.</strong></p>
        <p class="ind">This is your life. Act like the main character. Explore. Be bold. Don’t hold yourself back out of fear or expectations.</p>
        <p class="ind"><strong>18. Reach out and communicate better.</strong></p>
        <p class="ind">Say something when you need to. Clarify things with people. Don’t be afraid to speak up, ask, and connect. It’ll save you confusion and bring you closer to people.</p>
        <p class="ind"><strong>19. Let go of your pride and ego.</strong></p>
        <p class="ind">Just do what you want. You are forever changing, and you are not tied to one identity. You are free to evolve.</p>
        <p class="ind">And if there’s something in your life getting in the way of that evolution—GET RID OF IT.</p>
