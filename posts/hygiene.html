          <p class ="ind">Helloooo everyone! My name is Sarah, warm warm welcomes to my blog. Today I'll be talking about my best hygiene tips that'll have you looking clean, smelling fresh, and most importantly, FEELING fresh in your own body.</p>
          <p class ="ind">I want you to get on your hygiene and take it to the next level for YOU because I swear, the confidence you gain from knowing yourself that you are on your best hygiene and that anytime you are clean is worth everything. Presenting yourself in a clean manner is respectful to others and the world around you, but 100 times more, <strong>respectful towards yourself.</strong> I can guarantee you that focusing on having good hygiene will truly take your self-respect to new heights. </p>
          <p class ="ind">So let’s get into it. </p>
          <h4 class="subheading"> Before we begin...</h4>
          <p class ="ind">First things first I’M SORRY I have to do it to you, you have to drink your water. I’ll keep this point brief because it’s what everyone and their mom tells you to do, water will help you flush all of the toxins from your body that would’ve caused you to feel icky on the inside and outside. Drinking enough water will have your body and all its cute little organs functioning properly and working hard to keep everything running smoothly, which will cause you to GLOW from the inside. </p>
          <p class ="ind">A few tips for drinking more water if you struggle with this:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Get a nice water bottle or cup to drink from. I personally pour my water into a nice, big chalice. It really helps romanticize the mundanity of drinking water!</li>
            <li>Drink hot water to improve digestion</li>
            <li>Kickstart your day with a tall glass of water</li>
            <li>Add some flavor to your water - try lemons, electrolytes, or whatever excites you!</li>
          </ol>
          <p class ="ind">And while we're talking about nourishing ourselves from the inside, let's talk nutrition.</p>
          <p class ="ind">Then of course, in the same vein as drinking water, you gotta keep your nutrition on point too!! I could make a whole separate post about this, so I won’t bore you with it since I know you want to get into my juicy hygiene secrets, but treat yourself with whole, unprocessed foods. LOTS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. Foods with probiotics and prebiotics. Have a meal plan that optimizes your health and gets in all your macros (fat, protein, carbs) and vitamins and minerals. This’ll leave your body functioning at its BEST, which once again, will help you to GLOW from the inside and smelling fresh FROM THE INSIDE. </p>
          <br>
          <p class ="ind">Alright, let me start with my most important point that I wish I could tell everyone, because If someone asked me “If you could say one thing to the entire world, what would it be?” It would be this!!!</p>
          <h4 class="subheading">Down there.</h4>
          <p class ="ind"><strong>Water. Water. Every time. Yes. Water every time you use the restroom.</strong> Once I started using water after I washed myself every time after I used the restroom, it’s like I stepped into a different dimension of cleanliness and I’ve never looked back since. Let me tell you, I’m confused how with western culture and how it’s become so normalized to just use toilet paper after using the restroom, because it does not get the job done. If you had mud on your arm, you wouldn’t just wipe it with a dry paper towel, right?? You’d want to use water to clean up. Same thing down here. I don’t care. You could use a peri bottle, a regular spray bottle, a cup of water, wet wipes, or even just hop into the shower real quick. It takes like 2 minutes MAX and I PROMISE YOU, it makes all the difference. You will feel so much cleaner and better about yourself, you won’t feel any more irritation or itchiness down there, and you will SMELL 100x better afterwards. What this simple addition to my hygiene did to my confidence is CRAZY. It sounds silly but once you get on this, you start walking around in the world feeling divine. If you take anything from this video, I’m telling you, it’s this. </p>
          <p class ="ind">Alright, now that’s it for today that’s all I had to say. No but seriously, if there was one thing I could tell you, it would be that. </p>
          <p class ="ind">NOW UP NEXT,</p>
          <p class ="ind">Let’s talk about your underwear. Specifically, the fabric. Because it pains me to know that so many people are suffocating themselves in synthetic lace every day. So much fabric these days is made of polyester, which is literally plastic. Like imagine wearing a grocery bag as underwear. That doesn’t sound too nice, but in my mind, polyester is basically that.</p>
          <p class ="ind">So girl, let’s make the switch, TODAY. <strong>Breathable fabrics ONLY down there, </strong>the most common for underwear being cotton. COTTON UNDERWEAR ONLY FROM NOW ON. Cotton will let your skin breathe because of it’s good air circulation which prevents moisture buildup. And you know, bacteria and swear LOVEEEE moisture. cotton is absorbent, which will wick away moisture and keep you dry. Cotton is soft and hypoallergenic so it’s great for people with sensitive skin. So overall, cotton underwear will keep you feeling fresh down there and help prevent any unpleasant odors going on down there. And hey, while we’re at it, some days, ditch the underwear when you sleep. She’s suffocating all day, let her relax. Your skin needs time to breathe, and sleeping without underwear feels very freeing and your down there area will thank you. </p>
          <p class="ind">Now for periods, along the same lines, Ima need you to switch to cotton pads or tampons if you haven’t already. Commercial pads or tampons contain all these synthetic chemicals that you do NOT want near the most delicate and sacred part of your body!!! Plus, cotton menstrual products will have you smelling much much better down there during your period, which will definitely be a mood boost during this time of our month. In addition, please change your pad or tampon regularly, don’t push the limits. You probably know how it feels to be sitting with a blood-soaked pad or tampon for a long time, it’s not so pleasant, so just do yourself a favor and you will feel much better afterwards. If you want to take it a step further, consider using a menstrual cup. It’s a game-changer for hygiene. convenience, and the environment. They are made from medical-grade silicone, latex, or rubber, which are designed to be cleaned and reused for years, reducing waste and cost. They are easy to clean, all you need is a mild soap and water, and boiling them after each cycle will ensure thorough sterilization. They collect, not absorb menstrual flow, which helps prevent dryness and irritation, reducing the risk of infection. And some studies suggest that the menstrual cup does not disrupt vaginal flora, which is essential the vaginal microbiome/microorganisms that protect your body against urogenital infections.</p>
<p class="ind">And finally, grooming down there. I’m not saying you need to be bare like a newborn at all times, but regularly trimming down or removing hair down there will make maintaining cleanliness down there EASIER, not more clean necessarily but EASIER. I personally prefer keeping that area waxed most of the time, if not trimmed. I think about how every individual hair has a surface that can hold bacteria, dirt, sweat, all that. So if the hair has less surface, there is be less dirt the hair can hold and ultimately, it’ll be easier to keep clean. HOWEVER, it is very much possible to still be clean down there without doing any sort of hair removal, so this all comes down to personal preference. Do what makes you feel best and most comfortable.</p>
<p class="ind">A few extra tips to take your freshness down there up a level:</p>
<ol>
  <li >pH matters! Your downstairs has a natural balance, and harsh soaps can mess that up. Skip the fragranced washes. Just warm water is honestly enough, but if you want extra cleansing, go for a fragrance-free wash for that area.</li>
  <li >Change out of wet clothes ASAP. Sweaty gym leggings? A wet swimsuit? Bacteria loves moisture, so don’t sit around in damp clothing.</li>
  <li >Probiotics = your best friend. Eating yogurt, kimchi, or taking a probiotic supplement can help keep your natural flora balanced and prevent infections.</li>
</ol>
<p class="ind">Your hygiene down there is just as important as any skincare routine or hair routine. Take care of yourself, and I swear, you’ll feel the difference.</p>
<p class="ind">Now let’s talk about SHOWERS, because let’s be real – nothing feels better than stepping out of the shower, fresh, clean, and smelling amazing.</p>
<p class="ind">What completely changed the game for me was taking 3 showers a day. This might sound excessive, but HEAR ME OUT. I shower in the morning quickly after I do my morning business, and I make it a COLD ONE. This morning shower is more spiritual than hygienic, but hey, we care about our spiritual hygiene too. It has me stepping into the day on the right foot because I know I’ve started the day with a fresh slate, literally and figuratively. And the reason I make it cold is definitely more a mental thing. Off topic, but starting your day out with something challenging, hard, will encourage you throughout the day to continue doing hard and challenging things. And it may feel very uncomfortable at first, but eventually your body gets used to it I’ve found. And there’s something about cold showers where you step out of it, and you just feel on top of the world compared to if it was steaming hot. You’ll have to try it out for yourself.</p>
<p class="ind">The second shower of the day is in the afternoon, when I’ve been out and about. Maybe I went to class, or I went outside, or maybe I just need a quick pick-me-up. When I started adding in this midday shower, I’m not kidding you, my face got clearer. I predict it’s because I live in a city, there’s lots of construction, maybe air pollution, lots of things in the air that we can’t see and that dirt lands on our face. Washing this all off midday so it doesn’t sit there and marinate for the rest of the day has done NUMBERS for my face. And connecting back to my first point, if you’ve used the restroom until now and haven’t had a chance to wash yourself with water, then this shower is your chance to do just that as well. And mentally, I see this shower as a reset for the day. My mind feel so much clearer afterwards and I feel ready to tackle the rest of the day on a clean slate.</p>
<p class="ind">The third shower of the day is the nighttime one, which most of us do anyways. You want to make sure your clean before you go to bed so your bed isn’t’ a dumping ground for the days dirt. You’re sleeping in your bed, hopefully, at least 8 hours a day, so best believe you want to be clean and sleep in a clean environment. But most of all, there’s no better feeling than scrubbing off the day and stepping into your cozy bed.</p>
<p class="ind">You can call me crazy but I swear, hear me out and try this for yourself. You may not ever want to go back!! And these showers don’t need to be crazy easier, I usually take 5 minutes or less for each of them. They can just be quick refreshes for mental and physical hygiene.</p>
<p class="ind">So getting into what to ACTUALLY do during a shower, let’s start with hair.</p>
<ol>
  <li >Shampoo TWICE. The first wash gets rid of the product, oils, and dirt. The second wash actually cleans your scalp. And if you’re not using a scalp massager, girl, what are you doing? Get one. Your scalp will thank you.</li>
  <li >Conditioner goes on your ends ONLY. Not on your scalp. Repeat after me: not on your scalp. Your roots produce natural oils, so conditioner up there just makes things greasy faster.</li>
  <li >Wring out your hair before applying conditioner. Water dilutes the product, and we want those nutrients to actually absorb.</li>
</ol>
<p class="ind">Now, body care. This is where we level up.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use a washcloth, loofah, or exfoliating glove. Not only will you feel much cleaner, but that extra exfoliation will have your skin GLOWING and feeling so soft.</li>
  <li>Double cleanse your body if you’ve been sweating a lot. The first wash takes off dirt, the second actually cleanses.</li>
  <li>Your soap matters. If you want that long-lasting freshness, go for antibacterial or deep-cleansing body washes. I love unscented castile soap for an extra-clean feel before layering on a nice scented wash.</li>
  <li>Scrub your back. I know some of y’all are skipping your backs. Get a long loofah or back scrubber and stop neglecting that area.</li>
  <li>Feet. You need to be scrubbing them. Don’t be that person that just lets the water run off of them. Bacteria loves feet, and we do NOT do funky smells around here. In addition, if you don’t already, consider having shower shoes like flip flops. You don’t know what be touching the shower floor.</li>
</ol>
<p class="ind">A few extra shower tips to take things to the next level:</p>
<ol>
  <li >Cold water either the whole time or at the end. Hot water dries you up I swear it does, you’ll notice a real difference after you switch to cold water. It seals moisture in your hair and skin. Plus, it wakes you up and helps with circulation!</li>
  <li >Consider getting a shower filter.</li>
  <li >Exfoliate at least 2-3 times a week. Whether it's with a glove, a sugar scrub, or dry brushing before your shower—smooth skin is always the goal.</li>
  <li >Moisturize RIGHT after your shower. Your skin absorbs products best when it’s still damp, so don’t wait until you’re dry!</li>
  <li >Use an in-shower oil for that extra softness. Especially in winter—your skin will feel baby smooth.</li>
  <li >Switch to fragrance-free soap for sensitive areas. If you’re prone to irritation, scented body washes can throw off your pH.</li>
</ol>     
<p class ="ind">Your shower routine sets the tone for how you feel throughout the day. A good shower = a good mood. When you’re clean, exfoliated, moisturized, and fresh, you carry yourself differently. You feel put together. You feel unstoppable.</p>
<p class ="ind">So don’t just shower—make it an experience. Play some music, light a candle, romanticize it. Let your shower be a self-care moment, because you deserve it.</p>
<h4 class ="subheading">Oral Hygiene.</h4>
<p class ="ind">Alright, let’s talk oral hygiene. </p>
<p class = "ind">This is actually my favorite part of keeping myself clean, I would’ve started this all with oral hygiene, but I lowkey figured that it’s not as interesting as the others. BUT I GOT A FEW TIPS UP MY SLEEVE TO MAKE SURE YOUR BREATH STAYS FRESH. </p>
<p class ="ind">You could have your makeup, outfit, hair on point. But if your breath is kicking??? I don’t know about that one, let’s just not let that be a possibility, okay? 
<p class="ind">Your breath and teeth have got to be on point. Because you probably know that feeling, where you really want to talk to someone, but you just know your breath is HORRID. Or you’ve ever talked to someone and you just get a whiff of MINT and freshness, immediately you’re like <em>please, tell me more</em>. SO THAT’S GONNA BE YOU TODAY. 
<p class="ind">Lets go. </p>
<p class ="ind">I have to start with this, but your diet is VITAL in your oral hygiene. Have you ever noticed how dirty your teeth feel after eating sugar compared to if you had a meal with just vegetables, fruits, and meat? The difference is wild. When I quit sugar for long periods of time, my teeth get visibly whiter. I can’t speak much on coffee or soda since I don’t drink those, but I’m sure that cutting that stuff out or reducing your consumption of it will surely whiten your teeth as well. There are foods like onions, garlic, dairy, that make your breath just smell bad, but I won’t speak too much on those since they can be part of a healthy diet. But just consider, if you’re about to go to an important conference, or you’re about to meet lots of people, maybe skip the onions on your salad, maybeeee skip the cheese too. </p>
<p class="ind">I would recommend eating foods rich in calcium to strengthen teeth and bones, like dairy products, leafy greens, or calcium-fortified foods, eat foods rich in phosphorus, like meat and dairy to protect your tooth enamel, eat fruits and vegetables, which naturally help clean teeth and stimulate saliva production, and drink PLENTY OF WATER to rinse away food particles and acids, protecting your teeth from decay. </p>
<p class="ind">Lots of our cavities and bad breath are just caused from food, sugar, or acid, rotting away on our teeth for long periods of time. To have fresh breath, we are going to try to PREVENT THAT whenever we can.</p>
<p class="ind">First things first, if you’re still using a regular toothbrush, consider upgrading to an electric one. Manual brushing is fine, I was a big manual brusher for a long time, but the first time I brushed with an electric one, I was like “where has this been all my life???” Studies show that electric toothbrushes remove up to 21% more plaque and significantly reduce gingivitis compared to manual brushing. It’s because they do the work for you—oscillating and vibrating at a much higher frequency than your hand ever could. Less effort, better results. And let’s not forget—the angle you brush at matters. Brushing at a 45-degree angle ensures you’re also cleaning your gums, which prevents gum disease and receding gums.</p>
<p class="ind">Now, let’s talk about toothpaste. I personally prefer natural toothpaste, because a lot of commercial ones are filled with artificial sweeteners and chemicals that aren’t necessary for a clean mouth. Fluoride is a whole debate in itself, but I say go for what works for you. The real game-changer? DON’T RINSE YOUR MOUTH AFTER BRUSHING. I know it feels weird at first, but when you rinse, you’re washing away all the protective minerals that your toothpaste just deposited. Let the toothpaste sit on your teeth—it helps strengthen enamel and prevents cavities.</p>
<p class="ind">Oil pulling. It’s become kind of viral recently, but it’s been a thang for a while now. f you’ve never heard of it, its an ancient practice where you swish a tablespoon of coconut or sesame oil in your mouth for about 10-20 minutes, ideally before brushing your teeth. So many people talk about it these days, but I swear it’s for a reason and it’s not a fad. It whitens teeth naturally, pulls toxins from your mouth, and improves gut health. It sounds extra, but I swear, your mouth will feel so much cleaner and your breath will stay fresh for hours. Like try it one day, take some coconut oil and swish it around in your mouth. Then clank your teeth afterwards, your teeth feel sooo much stronger. And your mouth will feel great. </p>
<p class="ind">Let’s talk about flossing. If you’re not flossing, you’re not cleaning your teeth. Your toothbrush only reaches about 60% of the surface of your teeth, meaning that leftover food and bacteria just sit between your teeth causing bad breath, cavities, and gum disease. Floss like a maniac. Get between every single tooth, every single day. I don’t care if you’re tired or in a rush—floss. I personally floss after most meals, so that all that food isn’t chilling out on my teeth until I brush my teeth at night. It keeps my mouth feeling much cleaner throughout the day, you’ll thank yourself, and other people will thank you! Plus, flossing is sooo satisfying. There is nothing better than flossing and seeing all the food that would have been stuck in your mouth come out, really really does something for me. </p>
<p class="ind">Now, if you’re not on this already, let me PLEASE put you on. TONGUE SCRAPING. If you’re neglecting your tongue, that could be the source of your bad breath. Your tongue holds onto SO much bacteria, food particles, and dead cells, which is why tongue scraping is absolutely essential. I like to do it every single morning and after every meal if you can. A tongue scraper is much more effective than just brushing your tongue because it actually removes buildup instead of just spreading it around. You’ll notice an instant difference in your breath and how clean your mouth feels. I carry one in my bag as well at all times, instant breath freshener. </p>
<p class="ind">Speaking of breath—mouthwash is your friend, but only when used correctly. Some people make the mistake of using mouthwash before brushing, but it’s actually best to use it after meals, especially after eating sugary or acidic foods. It neutralizes bacteria, balances your pH, and gives you that fresh, clean feel. And don’t forget—make sure your mouthwash reaches your throat. Bad breath often comes from bacteria in your throat, not just your mouth, so gargle and let the mouthwash really work its magic. I try to use mouthwash after most meals. </p>
<p class="ind">If you’ve ever dealt with tonsil stones, you already know how much of a struggle they can be. These little white or yellowish clumps that form in the back of your throat are basically hardened bacteria, food particles, and dead cells. Your whole mouth could be CLEAN, PRISTINE, PERFECT, but if you have tonsil stones, you may have horrendous breath, and believe me I’ve been there, I hate them, they drive me crazy. I pick them out gently with a cotton swab or water flosser, or to prevent them, I try gargling and drinking water after all meals. This not only helps with tonsil stones, but simply rinsing your mouth with water washes away the acid and sugar from your meal. </p>
<p class="ind">Little more unknown tip, sanitize your toothbrush every few days by soaking it in hydrogen peroxide. You have no idea how dirty and grimy your toothbrush head is until you do this. Your toothbrush holds bacteria, so keeping it clean ensures you’re not reintroducing germs into your mouth. Your toothbrush practically feels brand new after doing this. </p>
<p class="ind">Finally, this might sound like a small thing, but always wipe your mouth after eating. Oils, food residue, and bacteria can linger on your lips and around your mouth, which can contribute to that not-so-fresh feeling. A simple wipe with a wet napkin or tissue, or ggoing to the restroom and wiping your mouth with water keeps you clean and polished. It’s something you don’t think about until you do it, and you never go back!!</p>
<p class="ind">So if I had to sum up what I said in one sentence, do MORE to prevent food, sugar, or acid left on your teeth to rot. FLOSS, TONGUE SCRAPE, MOUTHWASH, or brush your teeth after meals if you can so you don’t leave food, sugar, or acid stuck in there rotting on your teeth. Thinking about and implementing this, you’ll always have fresh breath. </p>
<p class="ind">When you take care of your oral hygiene, your whole presence changes. Your smile is brighter, your breath is fresh, and you just feel put together. A clean mouth isn’t just about appearance—it’s about health, confidence, and self-respect. So start taking it seriously, and I promise you’ll never go back.</p>
