      <div class="post-content">
        <p class="ind"> If there is one thing people know and remember me for, it’s how happy I am all the time. The most asked question I get is, <em>How are you always so happy? </em> And the most given compliment I receive is,<em> You are the most optimistic person I know; you’re a ray of sunshine. </em> </p>
         <p class="ind"> I never know how to respond because it’s hard to articulate this kind of state of pure bliss when it’s second nature to be in it. But for this post, it’s finally time to explore and reflect on the root of why and how I became this way. 
          <p class="ind">In this post, I touch on ten essential ways towards happiness: recognizing your greatest power, solitude, confidence, trusting in something greater, meaning, love, gratitude, social connection, health, and growth.</p>
          </p>
          <h4 class="subheading">Recognize your greatest power.</h4>
          <p class="ind">We cannot control what happens to us, only how we respond. The outside world can be cruel, toxic, and unpredictable, but our internal world is ours to shape.</p>
          <p class="ind">It’s unfortunate that when bad things happen these days, it’s like second nature to fall into a state of helplessness, thinking that there is nothing we can do and that we must bow to the way our circumstances are making us feel. But who wants to live like that? I could leave that as a rhetorical question, but I’m going to answer it for you: <strong>people who don’t want to take ownership and responsibility over their life will let anything slap them around and they will call it “bad luck” and “fate.”</strong> What a powerless existence! To have your attitude just go with the flow of whatever happens in your life. <em>If something bad happens, I am sad. If something good happens, I am happy</em>. How unstable, and yet this how most people behave. </p>
          <p class="ind">Happiness may seem like a wishy-washy state that comes and goes as it pleases, but happiness can sustain itself with a strong, disciplined mind. We must first accept that <strong> external circumstances are beyond our control, but our attitudes – our responses, our mindset, and how we navigate the world – are entirely within our power.</strong> Happiness, then, isn’t dictated by the chaos around us, but by the inner world we consciously create and maintain. </p>
          <p class="ind">A quote I live and die by, Viktor E. Frankl, a renowned psychology and holocaust survivor, said in his famous book <em>A Man’s Search for Meaning</em>, <strong>"Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms – to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”</strong> I encourage you to remember this quote, frame it up, and live by it. Start living with the full awareness that no matter what happens to you, no matter what’s taken away from you, you will always be able to choose your own attitude in any given set of circumstances.</p>
          <p class="ind">Harnessing this power requires self-awareness-the ability to notice and understand your thoughts. To master your mind, you must consciously reprogram it to think more optimistically and constructively. Your brain listens to everything you tell it; your word is impeccable to your brain. Your brain takes your words as truth, whether spoken in seriousness or jest. Sarcasm and self-deprecation may seem harmless, but your subconscious mind remembers everything it hears and interprets them as reality. By choosing your words carefully and cultivating an inner dialogue rooted in positivity and resilience, you can shape your mindset and, ultimately, your life.</p>
          <p class="ind">This kind of mind control holds immense power. It is a freedom that no one can strip from you. By mastering the art of choosing your responses, you gain control over your life, regardless of external circumstances. It’s this inner strength that shapes your reality and builds true resilience. When you can govern your attitude, you unlock a wellspring of power, enabling you to navigate even the toughest situations with grace. </p>
        <h4 class="subheading">Solitude. </h4>
          <p class="ind">What do you do when the external worlds feel unbearable, and happiness seems out of reach? It then becomes your responsibility to create something for yourself – an inner world that you can live in and be happy in. This means a world of solitude.  </p>
          <p class="ind">To quote Paul Tillich, “Language has created the word ‘loneliness’ to express the pain of being alone. And it has created the word ‘solitude’ to express the glory of being alone.” </p>
          <p class="ind"> Growing up, I went through phases where I was “socially exiled” from people in my life. As painful as it was at the time, this gave me plenty of time to correct any damaging behaviors I had and focus on inner development. 
            I was very much forced to be alone because I had no one by my side, but it led me to learn to love my own company. I was able to grow charisma, discipline, and self-awareness. I learned about myself. I achieved great things. I got ahead. 
            Through the creation of my own personal world, I discovered that, no matter what life throws my way, I know I always have my own back. Once you feel safe with yourself—knowing you will always be there for you, and knowing you can surpass anything that comes your way—you find that space to breathe and be calm. 
            This is where happiness can develop. </p>
          <p class="ind"> Solitude gives us time to self-reflect, restores our energy, and gets us away from the constant overstimulation our society overwhelms us with, creating the conditions necessary for happiness by allowing us to reconnect with ourselves, find inner peace, and cultivate a sense of fulfillment away from external pressures. </p>
          <h4 class="subheading"> Confidence.</h4>
          <p class="ind">Once we are comfortable in our solitude, we can work on our confidence.</p>
          <p class="ind">Having confidence in yourself makes you move through life on a completely different level, and you only know it once you’ve experienced it. You walk with a bold rhythm to your strides, your hips begin to sway gracefully, and every step rings with purpose. When you love yourself, everything around you becomes a reflection of that love. The beauty you see in yourself, you see in the world. This is because the way you feel internally always reflects how you view external situations. When you’re at peace with yourself, that peace extends outward, helping you perceive the world as more harmonious and beautiful. The world becomes a mirror. </p>
          <p class="ind">I could speak on self-confidence for hours, but the way your heart opens up, your shoulders lose their tension, how you just feel so free in the world, just being alive becomes a blissful experience. This is so important because as humans, we crave freedom, but we don’t know that we can find freedom right where we are if we just grow in self-love. </p>
          <p class="ind">Confidence doesn’t come from the perfect childhood or God-given talent or beauty. It comes from personal accountability which brings about self-respect, and self-respect will always light a way forward. </p>
          <p class="ind">Confidence is essential for happiness. You need confidence to be strong against the world in any circumstance. Once you can stand on your own two feet and know yourself well enough so you don’t crumble at every obstacle, you can find the space to be calm, the space to observe yourself and the place to relax. In this space, you create happiness. Connecting to the previous section, spending so much time in solitude gave me the opportunity to create self-respect and confidence. These are not things you can get from others. Self-confidence has to do with your self. It has nothing to do with the crowd judging you. You need to be solid as a person so you can take the blows from society.</p>
          <p class="ind">From a young age, I recognized that I didn’t fit in like many people do. But think about this: an existence where you just go around trying to fit in everywhere is empty. You don’t actually exist; you just change whenever something new comes along. Even though I experienced great heartbreak at this time, crying many nights as a young girl wondering what could be wrong with me, in hindsight, this was exactly the stepping stone and the turning point I needed to grow the kind of confidence I have today. The confidence and self-assurance you gain from being broken down by the world and picking up the pieces yourself is monumental. Remember the feeling from when you were broken, you helped yourself get back up? You probably felt like, Oh yeah, I did that. When this self-trust builds over time, it buds into great self-confidence, and it will start to feel amazing just to exist in yourself. </p>
          <p class="ind">	We could talk about the connection between confidence and happiness forever. Confidence frees you from fear and self-doubt, helping you live authentically and pursue what matters most to you. It enables you to face challenges with resilience, build meaningful relationships, and celebrate your achievements with pride. Confidence brings inner peace, letting you not worry so much about how others perceive you. It shifts your focus to your possibilities and strengths, which fosters a growth mindset that enhances your overall sense of joy and fulfillment. Ultimately, confidence empowers you to navigate life with ease, purpose, and optimism. </p>
         <h4 class="subheading">Trust in something greater.</h4>
          <p class="ind">	Now you know that no matter what happens to you, you will always be able to choose your attitude in any given circumstance, and now that you’ve built enough confidence in yourself to trust that you have your own back in any situation, it would be in your best interest to start trusting that no matter what happens, you will be okay. Matter of fact, take it a step further and wholeheartedly trust that whatever happens in your life happens for a reason. </p>
          <p class="ind">	You’ve probably been through a lot in your life. You could easily decide to let your past continue to negatively affect your life in the present. You could use your past as an excuse for failure, <strong>or the fuel for your hunger to succeed.</strong> Reframe your mindset: stop seeing yourself as a victim of your circumstances, but as someone who is lucky enough to have experienced this much life and learned so much. </p>
          <p class="ind"> I believe that our lives are a perfectly crafted curriculum for us to evolve into the best versions of ourselves, that every hardship we go through is meant to teach us something we desperately need to know, or guide us to a greater path in our life that we may not be able to conceive yet. By believing this, I can go through every obstacle with the full trust that I am strong enough to get through it, everything will come to a past, and I will come out stronger and better than before.</p>
          <p class="ind">	With this trust, you create a powerful foundation for peace and happiness. This mindset shifts your focus from fear and resistance to acceptance and growth. By trusting in this belief, you free yourself from the burden of unnecessary stress and self-doubt, cultivating a great resilience that allows you to face life with optimism and strength. Knowing that you’ll come out stronger and better, no matter the circumstances, fosters deep hope and joy, making happiness not just a fleeting emotion, but a way of life. </p>
          <p class="ind">	In other words, when you trust that you can choose your attitude in any situation and believe that everything happens for a reason, you open your heart to God’s plan for your life. This faith allows you to see challenges not as random misfortunes, but as purposeful parts of a divine curriculum designed to help you grow and evolve into the person you were created to be. When you see your obstacles as opportunities to strengthen your relationship with your creator and trust that everything is working for your good, you will discover a happiness rooted in faith – a joy that is unshakable and eternal. </p>
          <p class="ind">	When things don’t seem to go your way, trust that there is a reason. Trust that God has designed a plan for you much greater than anything you could imagine. Refuse to let obstacles consume and dissipate the quality of your life at the present moment. Instead of having a “Why me?” mindset, think instead “What is the universe trying to teach me?”</p>
          <h4 class="subheading">Meaning.</h4>
          <p class="ind">	Meaning gives your heart something to hold onto when the prospect of happiness may seem bleak. The TED Talk <em>There’s more to life than being happy</em> by Emily Efsahani Smith forever changed my life for the better. Meaning in life comes from belonging somewhere, serving something beyond yourself, and from developing the best within you. She explains how there are four pillars to a meaningful life: belonging, purpose, transcendence, and storytelling. </p>
          <p class="ind">	Belonging comes from relationships where you are valued for who you are, and where you, in turn, value others. True belonging is rooted in love, and thrives in the genuine, meaningful moments shared between individuals. </p>
          <p class="ind">Purpose is the sense of direction in life that comes from dedicating yourself to something beyond and other than yourself. It’s about identifying what you can contribute to the world by using your unique strengths, talents, and passions to make a positive impact. Purpose transforms your actions into something meaningful and enduring, anchoring you in a life of fulfillment and direction. </p>
          <p class="ind">Transcendence describes the states that life you beyond the mundane, where your sense of self dissolves, and you feel connected to something greater. This can be found anywhere but many find it in religion, art, writing, reading, anything that elevates you to feel part of a higher order. </p>
          <p class="ind">Finally, storytelling is the story you tell yourself about yourself. It’s how you make sense of your experiences, helping you understand how you became you. By thoughtfully reflecting on your life and reframing the stories you tell yourself, you gain clarity and uncover new insights that help you find good even in challenges, cultivating the wisdom and strength to sustain you through life’s obstacles.</p>
          <h4 class="subheading">Love.</h4>
          <p class="ind"> I don't just mean romantic love. I mean love as a state of being – a profound way of existing in harmony with the world and ourselves. When we learn to love the world as it is – imperfect, yet astonishingly beautiful – we cultivate an appreciation for life’s intricacies and wonders. And that same love reflects inward to ourselves, nurturing resilience and helping us embrace life’s uncertainties with optimism and hope.</p>
          <p class="ind">Imagine a life where you unconditionally love the world – can you imagine how blissful that must be? To live in such a state is to align yourself with the highest vibrations of existence, where love becomes not just an action or feeling, but the essence of who you are. </p>
          <p class="ind">The frequency of love is immensely high-vibrational, radiating warmth, joy, and peace into everything it touches. When you pour love into the world – into people, nature, moments, and even imperfections – that energy doesn’t dissipate; it reflects and amplifies, electrifying your own heart. This flow of love creates an unending cycle of positivity and light, a harmony that sustains your happiness and fuels your soul.  </p>
          <p class="ind">To love the world unconditionally is to embrace life as it is, swinging from being cruel to breathtakingly beautiful. It’s a state of being where gratitude thrives, optimism flourishes, and you become deeply connected to the boundless energy that surrounds us all. </p>
          <h4 class="subheading">Gratitude.</h4>
          <p class="ind">Greatly related to the previous section on love, gratitude makes us happier by shifting our focus from what we lack to what we have cultivating a mindset of abundance. When we practice gratitude, we actively acknowledge the positive aspects of our lives - whether they're big or small. This recognition enhances our overall well-being and helps us find meaning and fulfillment in the present moment.  </p>          
          <p class="ind">Psychologically, gratitude literally rewires your brain by encouraging the release of "happy" chemicals like dopamine and serotonin. By practicing gratitude continuously, it becomes second nature to think from a grateful heart, thus training our minds to naturally release these "feel-good" chemicals often. </p>   
          <p class="ind">Moreover, gratitude builds resilience. In difficult times, it allows us to find the silver lining, shifting our perspective and providing hope. Instead of being consumed by challenges, we learn to celebrate the strength we've gained and the lessons we've learned. It serves you to look back at the hard times of your life with a grateful heart and be appreciative of how those experiences shaped you to be a better person today.  </p>
          <p class="ind">Ultimately, gratitude creates a foundation for happiness by grounding us in the present, shifting our perspective for the better, and filling our hearts with appreciation and joy. It's a simple practice with great effects that transform our lives.  </p>
          <h4 class="subheading"> Social Connection.</h4>
          <p class="ind">	The longest study on happiness ever conducted, following the lives of hundreds of men for nearly 80 years, found that the quality of one’s close relationships was the most significant predictor of happiness and longevity. To quote Margaret Wheatly, “Relationships are all there is. Everything in the universe only exists because it is in relationship to everything else. Nothing exists in isolation. We have to stop pretending we are individuals that can go it alone.” </p>
          <p class="ind">	Humans will always be deeply social creatures. Our evolutionary roots have encoded in our DNA to stick with a pack; the survival of early humans depended on strong social bonds because if they didn’t have a web of people to survive with, they died. This need for connection runs deep within our genes, shaping our instincts and emotions. Even though modern life has allowed humans the opportunity to survive independently, our innate drive for connection hasn’t changed. We still crave companionship because it provides a sense of safety, belonging, and fulfillment. While we may no longer rely on a pack for physical survival, our emotional and mental well-being still thrives on meaningful relationships.   </p>
          <p class="ind">Connection reminds us that we are not alone- that we are part of something greater. By fostering relationships and embracing the joy of togetherness, we invite more happiness and love into our lives.</p>
          <h4 class="subheading">Health.</h4>
          <p class="ind">	Caring for your health is absolutely necessary to achieve happiness. You need to get your eating, exercising, and sleeping habits in order. A healthy body supports a healthy mind, as they influence and reinforce each other in ways we are unconscious of. This section deserves many separate posts of its own, but I will touch on why eating healthy, exercise, and sleep are all crucial to sustaining happiness.  </p> 
          <p class="ind">Our gut is often called our “second brain” because of the way our gut microbiome directly communicates with our brain. Our gut plays a surprising and significant role in our mental well-being, including the production of serotonin, a key neurotransmitter that regulates mood, sleep, and happiness. In fact, about 90% of the body’s serotonin is produced in the gut, so what we eat directly impacts the health of our gut and, in turn, serotonin production. Fiber-rich foods, fermented foods, and foods high in omega-3 fatty acids feed beneficial gut bacteria, while processed foods and excess sugars can disrupt the gut microbiome, leading to reduced serotonin levels and increased susceptibility to anxiety and depression.  </p> 
          <p class="ind">Exercise has innumerable benefits for the human body, it feels like a crime to try to summarize everything in one paragraph. Exercise is called a “natural anti-depressant” because it stimulates the release of endorphins, serotonin, and dopamine, neurotransmitters that elevate mood and reduce stress, while also increasing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to support brain health and resilience. Additionally, exercise lowers cortisol levels (the stress hormone), reducing anxiety and promoting calmness. Aside from all the biochemical effects of exercise that aid in happiness, exercise enhances self-confidence through building trust and discipline with oneself. Setting and reaching fitness goals and improving physical strength or endurance contribute to a stronger sense of self-worth, directly boosting emotional well-being.  </p> 
          <p class="ind">Numerous studies have found that quality sleep is a key determinant of overall life satisfaction, and some even say it is the most important factor. Two critical factors stand out when assessing sleep quality: hours slept and consistency of sleep-wake times. Adequate sleep duration is essential for physical restoration, cognitive function, and emotional regulation, while regularity in sleep patterns, meaning going to bed and waking up at the same times each day, aligns the body’s circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is our internal biological clock, and living according to it promotes better sleep, mental clarity, emotional balance, and overall well-being. I would highly recommend seeing Matthew Walker’s work in his research on sleep to learn more. </p> 
          <p class="ind">I can almost guarantee that anyone who pays attention to their eating, exercise, and sleep habits carefully will find themselves significantly happier than those who don’t. Happiness isn’t just about cultivating a positive mindset; it requires good health to speak for itself as well. When both the mind and body are nurtured, they function in harmony to create a happy human.  </p> 
          <h4 class="subheading">Growth.</h4>
          <p class="ind"> 	Growth is not just a phase or a goal – it’s a constant, ongoing process. As we navigate life, we’re constantly evolving, becoming more aware, more resilient, and more capable than before. The journey I’ve shared with you here – the cultivation of happiness – is not about reaching a destination. It’s about continuously becoming the best version of yourself. When you recognize that growth is infinite, every step you take toward your higher self feels deeply fulfilling.  </p> 
          <p class="ind">By following the principles I’ve outlined—embracing solitude, cultivating self-awareness, choosing positivity, and trusting in a greater plan—you will experience extraordinary growth you could’ve never imagined. With each challenge faced and each success achieved, you'll find yourself rising higher than you ever thought possible. The process of growth itself becomes the ultimate joy, as you realize that you’re always evolving, always becoming more than what you were yesterday. </p> 
          <p class="ind">Never stop growing—as you evolve, you unlock even greater potential within you, and this is what makes the pursuit of happiness so powerful. The more you grow, the more you realize the immense power you hold within yourself to shape your world and your life. </p> 
          <p class="ind">In the end, it’s not just about becoming the best version of yourself for the sake of achievement. It’s about embracing that journey and knowing that every step you take toward growth brings you more happiness, fulfillment, and purpose. Growth is the key to joy, and the more we embrace it, the more we elevate our lives to heights we never imagined possible. </p> 
          <h4 class="subheading">Signing off...</h4>
          <p class="ind">	I sincerely hope you’ve enjoyed my manifesto on how to cultivate a happy life. Everything I’ve outlined has truly helped me in my own journey to a happier, more fulfilled life, and I wholeheartedly believe it can help guide you on your path as well. With all my heart, may you find joy in every second of your precious life.  </p> 
          <br>
