        <p class ="ind">This is going to be a devotional post to me and my future self. </p>
        <p class ="ind">All the crossroads you've come to have led you here through the decisions you decided to make. Do I go left or right? I'm proud of your decision-making, Sarah.</p>
        <p class ="ind">I'm lucky to live the life I'm living right now because of you, Sarah. You've been there for me every step of the way. Taking care of me, maintaining my happiness, learning about me, you've done everything you can to ensure I am living the best life possible. I really appreciate you.</p>
        <p class ="ind">I want you to build up that momentum again, Sarah. I can sense that you've been faltering in your choices, they are not aligning with what you truly want. I'm here to remind you of your power: your gift of chioce. From choosing your attitude in any given circumstance, to making menial deicisons throughout the day, to a pivotal decision at a large crossroad in your life, your choices add up. 
        <p class ="ind">Until now, the choices you've made have led me here, and I am forever grateful. You've gotten me out of every single mess I got myself into. You hold such immense power, Sarah. I admire you. </p>
        <p class ="ind">Let this postbe a reminder for you, Sarah. You can turn your life around whenever you want. You always have some sort of choice to make, because no one will ever be able to take away the ability to choose your attitude in any circumstance. And luckily, you have much much more free reign than just that. I trust you to make the best decisions for me and my higher self. I trust you Sarah to take care of me and make decisions that have my best interest in mind. I trust you to give me the highest quality of life I can imagine.</p>
        <p class ="ind">And it all starts here, Sarah. It starts in this moment, when you choose to sit up taller, to take a deep breath that fills your lungs completely, to smile a little bit more today. It started with your decision this morning to not doomscroll on Instagram right when you woke up, and you remembered the feeling of having so much clarity and peace of mind in the morning. It was such a sacred time getting ready this morning, and it was all because of your choice to tune into your body and what you truly need in the morning.</p>
        <P class ="ind">I trust you to continue making good decisions, and even when you don't make the best decisions, I will ALWAYS trust you to get me out of them. You don't falter, you never stop, you always get back up and try again. That is what I admire about you. You never give in.</P>
        <p class ="ind">The journey to your highest self is a personal one. I love that you refused to be held hostage to your past mistakes. It was then, that you truly internalized that everyone has the power to change and create their own destined reality for themselves. You past poor decisions never diminished your value, it made you stronger. It built depth of character. It gave you wisdom. It was never the end for you! It's never the end for anyone. The end comes only when one accepts defeat, and you didn't.</p>
        <p class ="ind">You didn't accept your circumstances. You didn't accept where your bad choices had led you. You could've continued living the way you've always knownm but you cultivated values and you're cultivating a life for yourself that you didn't even know could exist for you!!! How crazy. You had faith in yourself. You had that drive, ambition, and faith. You seriously don't credit yoursel ENOUGH.</p>
        <p class ="ind">Sarah, never let anyone nake you feel unworthy for your past decisions. You've always been worthy. You've always been everything. How you've changed despite being in an environment that beats you down and completely discredits you is a testament to your power of choice. </p>
        <p class ="ind">Your continual choice to perservere no matter what has been nothing short of amazing. I'm the luckiest girl in the world to live with someone like you. Someone who stops at nothing, never stays complacent, and always reaches for her goals. I'm absolutely in love with you, Sarah. You are so inspiring, so strong, you are incredible, and you are someone worth knowing and loving.</p>
        <p class ="ind">Sarah, continue striving for greatness. You are bound for it and you've known this from a young age. Let the power of your own choice lead you to heights unimaginable. You have no idea what is in store for you, but I just need you to trust me. Trust in your good choices, and you will be rewarded heavily byy the life you will one day live. I promise you greatness, happiness, success, and everything wonderful in the world. </p>
