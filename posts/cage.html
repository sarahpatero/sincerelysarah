                    <strong>Being too much is better than being nothing at all.</strong> You're more than mediocrity. You're more than just hiding in the shadows, living life on autopilot.</p>
                    
                    <p class="ind">I’m so sick of seeing people not living life marching to their own drums. It pains me to see people plagued by any sort of resistance that prevents them from living out their full potential. Whether it be the fear of judgement, lack of motivation and purpose, WHATEVER IT IS, we need to get it cured ASAP.</p>
                    
                    <p class="ind">Because you weren’t meant to live life trapped in a cage, you were meant to <strong>FLY.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p class="ind">I have a theory: belief without action leads to depression. When you believe you can do something, but don’t act on it, that tension becomes anxiety in the body, or depression in your spirit. Your higher-self craves to see you max out all the levels in the game of life, and when you know that you’re meant for more, but don’t act on it, you intrinsically feel like you failed yourself.</p>
                    
                    <p class="ind">So now let me convince you of one of the most common reasons why we feel paralyzed to live life loud.</p>
                    
                    <p class="ind"><strong>The Fear of Judgement.</strong><br>
                    Not failure, not lack of opportunity, but the tumultuous thought of being seen trying. This fear has silenced too many of our ideas, so much of our voice, and stopped our motion right in our tracks.</p>
                    
                    <p class="ind"><strong>But NO MORE.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p class="ind">We’ve been conditioned to crave approval more than living authentic to ourselves. But take a second to ask, why are we seeking validation more than our purpose? Editing ourselves into versions that we think the world will clap for gives us <em>NOTHING</em> valuable. At the end of the day, we would have created a life that we hate living, giving everything to pleasing people who we will never know.</p>
                    
                    <p class="ind">I’ve had my fair share of betraying the version of myself that knows what I’ve been capable of, and it’s never led to anything substantial or anything I’m proud of, that’s for sure. All I’ve been left with is a life that I don’t actually want to live, all for what? All for living in accordance with how I think people (that I don’t even like or care about) want me to act.</p>
                    
                    <p class="ind"><strong>Fear of judgement is one of the greatest killers of potential on Earth.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p class="ind">Those stuck in the cage are the loudest critics.</p>
                    
                    <p class="ind">Say this to yourself every morning:<br>
                    “I’m not going to be everyone’s cup of tea, but I seriously do not give a f-”</p>
                    
                    <p class="ind">The people that judge you aren’t the kind of people you likely want in your life anyways. They’re not laughing because you look “ridiculous,” they’re laughing because your courage confronts their cowardice. Your voice reminds them of the one they buried. And your fire exposes the cold, dim places in their own souls that they’ve neglected for too long, manifesting outwardly in hatred and judgement towards you.</p>
                    
                    <p class="ind">It's easier to criticize than to create, and much easier to criticize others than to criticize yourselves. That’s why so many choose to sit on the sidelines of life. Just remember there’s a reason why they’re on the bench and you’re on the field. As a wise man once said, why are you hating on the club, you can’t even get in???</p>
                    
                    <p class="ind">A brave person syncing to their own beat isn’t going to judge you, because like attracts like. The kind of people that are leveled up, live life confidently and freely, don’t judge other people who do the same because judging others 1.) is a low-vibrational activity and 2.) detracts attention away from our own lives.</p>
                    
                    <p class="ind">It’s actually the dumbest fucking funniest thing to see people judging me. Or spending all that damn energy judging me when they could be spending that energy going to the damn gym. Like if they spent even HALF of that energy that they spend criticizing other people on themselves, shii maybe THEN they could be them since that’s what they want sooo bad. The people that criticize you, sometimes they really do just be jealous!!!!</p>
                    
                    <p class="ind">And man let me say, it’s okay to be jealous. But channel that jealousy into <strong>ENERGY SPENT ON YOURSELF.</strong> Jealousy is an invitation to look inside yourself and see where you may be lacking. The triggers are what you need sometimes to see where you want to improve yourself. Jealous of a girl’s looks??? Probably a sign that you should start investing more in your appearance. Jealous of a girl’s happiness? Probably a sign that you need to work on lightening up and stop taking life so damn seriously.</p>
                    
                    <p class="ind">So I’m going to invite you to just pray for your critics. See them as people that genuinely need help. They don’t know how to handle their triggers, and there are places in their lives where they feel lack, and that’s why they’re picking you apart because <strong>YOU</strong> have what they want, in one way or another. People want what they can’t have, and they <strong>HATE</strong> when others have what they want.</p>
                    
                    <p class="ind">An audacious life, in so many ways, is all that people want. The freedom to express yourself authentically is what most <strong>WISH</strong> they could do. The audacity to take on every endeavor that comes your way, and the sheer will it takes to have the kind of skills, knowledge, and discipline that you have is <strong>ENVY-INDUCING.</strong></p>
